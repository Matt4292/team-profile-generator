# team-profile-generator

## Description 
In this project my task was to make a team profile generator that would take in user input from the command line and generate an HTML file displaying team members and the associated information. I used Bootstrap to style the html and make the cards, and inquirer prompts to get the information needed from the user.

## Installation 
You will need Node.js installed on your machine to use this. Once you clone the repo you will also need to install inquirer in the folder by typing ```npm install inquirer``` into your terminal
